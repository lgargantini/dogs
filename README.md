# Dogs Challenge

Welcome to the Dogs Challenge!

We have a small React application that fetches a list of dog breeds and subbreeds.
It renders them in a list, and lets the user click one to display some random pictures of the dog.

## The Ask

Our PM isn't very happy with the UX of the app and has asked that you implement an autocomplete/typeahead so that it is easier for the users to find the dog breed they are looking for.

- As a user, I want to be able to click on my choice from a list of suggestions that match what I've typed so far. [`DONE`]
- As a user, I want to be able to hit 'Enter' to select the top suggestion. [`DONE`]
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate the suggestions using arrow keys. [`DONE`]

- You've heard that we will need similar functionality in another part of the application, so this component should be reusable. [`DONE`]

- She's also not pleased with the way images are rendered on the screen. They are all different sizes, and it would be much nicer if they uniformly arranged in a grid. [`DONE`]
